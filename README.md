# SPHinXsys

#### Description
SPHinXsys (pronunciation: s'finksis) is an acronym from Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics for industrial compleX systems. 
It provides C++ APIs for physical accurate simulation and aims to model coupled industrial dynamic systems including fluid, solid, multi-body dynamics 
and beyond with SPH (smoothed particle hydrodynamics), a meshless computational method using particle discretization. 
Please check the documentation of the code at https://xiangyu-hu.github.io/SPHinXsys/

SPHinXsys is a multi-physics, multi-resolution SPH library. 
Although it is not a standalone application itself, 
many examples designated for the specific type of applications are provided.

#### Software Architecture
SPHinXsys is cross-platform can be compiled and used in Windows, Linux and Apple systems.

#### Installation

The detailed installation instructions for all platforms can be found in the pdf file /tutorials/SphinXsys.pdf.
